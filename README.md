Geofencing
=======================

Introduction
------------
A geofence is a virtual perimeter defined by GPS or RFID around a real world area. 
Geofences can be created with a radius around a point location. 

Treasure-
- A treasure hunt app that uses geofences to mark the place where the treasure is hidden. When you enter that place, you will be notified that you have won!.

Pre-requisites
--------------
- The latest version of Android Studio.
- A minimum of SDK API 29 on your device or emulator. (This should still work on lower API levels but may look differenti.)

Getting Started
---------------
1. Download and run the app.
2. If you are running API 29 or higher, grant the "Always allow" permission; otherwisa, grant "Allow" for location permissions.

Note: If you are running this app on an emulator, you will need to use another app to pull location data from.
This is because geofencing relies on device sensors to detect the location of the device, which the emulator cannot access.
